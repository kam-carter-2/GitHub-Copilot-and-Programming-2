REFLECTION (Approx. 250 words)
======================

What did you ask Copilot to help you build?
I asked GitHub Copilot to help create a simple social media feed with a post input, a like button, and a live like counter.
I broke the problem into steps: first generating a basic HTML structure, then adding CSS styling, and finally implementing JavaScript
functions for posting and liking.

How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?
At first I gave broad instructions like “make a social media feed.”
As I progressed, I shifted to focused prompts such as “add a like counter that updates when clicked.”
This produced more accurate and useful completions.

What surprised you about the process?
I was surprised how quickly Copilot generated working code snippets, including event listeners and DOM manipulation.
It helped reduce boilerplate but still required me to debug and tweak styles.

What did you learn about the technology you used?
I learned more about how to manipulate the DOM directly with createElement, innerHTML, and addEventListener.
I also learned how Copilot interprets structured prompts.

What would you do differently next time?
Next time I would plan a slightly more complex feature set (for example, saving posts to local storage) and spend more time
testing on different screen sizes to improve responsiveness.
